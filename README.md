# dl_course_iWildCam
Solution For kaggle challange for iWildCam 2019

# Already done:
- Used <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/images/transfer_learning_with_hub.ipynb">TF example</a>
- Dataset was downloaded and extracted
- Trained over this dataset
- Used it on our data (inference then train / fine-tune)
- Split to train / validate
- Used spacial feature extraction
- Evaluate on train / validate / test set
- Submission with dummy file, just to check the format

## ToDo
- Submit to Kaggl
- Check that all works, including dataset exploration
- Check notebooks and pickup some ideas

## Data
