Solution For kaggle challange for iWildCam 2019

# Already done:
- Used <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/images/transfer_learning_with_hub.ipynb">TF example</a>
- Dataset was downloaded and extracted
- Trained over this dataset
- Used it on our data (inference then train / fine-tune)
- Split to train / validate

## ToDo
- Loss problem - to check again the labels VS predictions
- Evaluate on train / validate / test set
- Submit to Kaggle
- Split to 4 x 3 slices
- Train also the feature extractor
- Use also grayscale images
